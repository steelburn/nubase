# Nubase Documentation

Nubase is an open-source backend service born for AI-native applications and AI Coding workflows. It gives generated apps and agent-built products a real backend target instead of a pile of one-off scripts.

It combines four primitives in one self-hostable platform:

- Memory
- Database
- Storage
- Auth

The project is Supabase-inspired, but it is built around two core differences:

- first-class AI memory as a platform primitive
- AI Coding and agent workflows through stable REST APIs, Studio, and MCP-friendly database tools
- self-hosted multi-project support through database-per-project isolation
